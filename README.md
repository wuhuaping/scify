# scify
Python Smart Contract Framework (Ethereum and Ethereum Classic)

## What is Scify?

Scify is meant to be a layer of abstraction between your python application
and the Ethereum (Classic) network.  

## Who is the Audience?
Application developers who want a library to programmatically access the Ethereum or 
Ethereum Classic networks, without having to worry about the nitty gritty details
of forming valid JSON-RPC calls and sending them to a node.  You just want to 
have a simple API and let the library handle the boilerplate stuff.

If you are not looking to integrate Ethereum or Ethereum Classic functionality
into your python app this is not the library you seek.  If you want a GUI then
mist or ethereum-harmony may be closer to meeting your needs
